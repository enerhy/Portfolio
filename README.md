# Portfolio
This repository contains a subset of the projects I've been working on. 
The content will be continuously updated since I am improving the existing projects and adding new ones.
The aim of this repoisitory is to show my knowledge to people interested.

## Visual:
* **Face Recognition:** FaceNet, Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Network and a linear SVC with Kearas
* **Neuro Style Transfer:** Generating Images based VGG19 implementing Style and Content Loss from intermediate layers and training using TF20 Graph mode
* **Recognizing Blood Cells disorders:** An exercise of implementing several different CNN type of blocks/layers including: ResNet blocks, Inception blocks, One-to-One convolutions. Additionally, partiall reuse of pretrained weights on ResNet50 and Inception with self-training of part of the network with early stopping.
* **Cifar10:** Image Classification with 10 classes. Use of basic EDA and custom CNN for prediction.
## Tabular:
* **House SalePrice Prediction:** Regression problem. EDA and use of a number of Feature Engineering and Feature Selection techniques. Finally use of ANN and XGBoost for prediction
* **Santander Customer Satisfaction:** Classification problem with highly imbalanced data. EDA and use of a number of Feature Engineering and Feature Selection techniques. Two of the most modern gradient boosted descision tree models: XGboost and LightGBM are applied to make predictions with weighting the loss due to the unbalanced data.
* **Categorical Encoding:** Use of a number of categorical encoding techniques including: Ordinal label encoding, Binary encoding, Hash tricks, Encoding based on mean target value, Encoding based on alphabetical order of strings, Encoding of cyclical data
